//! Finding the `claude` binary when the app wasn't launched from a shell.
//!
//! A bundled `.app` started from Finder or the Dock inherits `launchd`'s
//! environment, not the user's. On macOS that means a `PATH` of roughly
//! `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` — none of which holds `claude`, which
//! installs to `~/.local/bin` or a node version manager's bin directory. So
//! `Command::new("claude")` resolves under `pnpm tauri dev` and fails from the
//! bundle, which is the same binary behaving differently by how it was started.
//!
//! Resolved once into a `OnceLock` and reused: the login-shell probe below costs
//! real time (a shell reading the user's whole rc chain), and the answer can't
//! change while the app runs.
